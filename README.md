# Virtua Habit Tracker

## Description
Virtua is a personal project developed to enhance my programming skills and professionalism while providing a tool for habit tracking. This app serves as a platform for me to explore web development technologies, focusing on React.js and Node.js. It helps users create habits, track daily progress, and visualize their success. I started this project to not only sharpen my own skills but also to build something that helps others stay motivated and achieve their personal goals.


## Technologies
- React.js
- Node.js
- CSS
- Planned: Node.js/Express for server backend and MongoDB for database management

## Installation
To run Virtua locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
You can clone using HTTPS or SSH:

#### HTTPS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SibhatY/habit-tracker.git
```
#### SSH
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SibhatY/habit-tracker.git
```

## Setup
Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd habit-tracker/client
npm install
```

## Running the Application
To start the app on your local machine from the client directory, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Roadmap

These are some of the implementations that are planned for future versions of Virtua:

- **New Features:** Introduce new screens for analytics to show habit trends and achievement screens to celebrate user milestones and gamify the app.
- **Splash Page & Dashboard Completion:** Fully develop the splash page and dashboard to provide an overview of user habits and achievements.
- **UI Improvement:** Enhance the UI to make it more visually appealing and professional.
- **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to allow personal accounts and secure access to user data.
- **Backend Integration:** Implement a Node.js backend API to handle processing and storage.
- **Database:** Use MongoDB for consistent data storage, allowing user profiles and habit tracking through multiple sessions.
